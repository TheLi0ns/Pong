[Download the setup](https://github.com/TheLi0ns/Pong/releases/latest/download/Pong_setup.exe) <br />
I've recreated the classic game Pong. I want to learn game dev this is my third project

## Description
Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. 
The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it horizontally across the down or up side of the screen. 
They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side or it can be controlled by the computer. 
Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth and score a point when the opponent fails to hit the ball. Plus the players have some powers: 
defensive ones that can be activated after 3 suffered goals and offensive ones that can be activated after 5 suffered goals

## Powers
### Defensive powers:
  * ***speed:*** it increases the movement speed; 
  * ***large racket:*** it stretches the player paddle;
  * ***parry:*** block any shot for 100ms;
  * ***large ball:*** it enlarges the ball while it's going against the player until the player itself hit it.
### Offensive powers:
  * ***fireshot:*** increase the ball speed after the collision;
  * ***inverted controls:*** invert the opponent's controls; 
  * ***shrink:*** shrinks the opponent paddle; 
  * ***small ball:*** shrinks the ball while it's going against the opponent until the opponent itself hit it.

## Mini-games
### Dribble
This is a single player minigame that simulates juggling with the paddle. It's based on the score that will be the number of juggles
### Boss fights
This is a single player minigame that makes the player fights against some bosses.
The player only have 3 HP, so he can only suffer 3 goals and he can use the parry
defensive power but only 5 times per round. <br />
